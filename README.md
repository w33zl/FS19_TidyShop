The goal of this mod is to to clean up the store to make it easier to find the right equipment for every task. A secondary goal is to give the store a more uniform look and feel.

## Category changes:
- New specialized vehicle categories like Hooklift, SwapBody/AR, Fixed-body trucks, Light Commercial Vehicles, Construction, Excavators and more.
- New specialized trailer categories for Light Trailers, Semitrailers, Liquid Transport and UTV/ATV trailers.
- New specialized categories for tools/implements like Hooklift Containers, SwapBody Superstructures, Cranes & Transport, Snow Removal and Hand Tools.
- Additional variants of basegame categeries like Compact Tractors and XL/Tracked Tractors.

## Additional features:
- Unique and descriptive category thumbnails in the same style as basegame categories.
- More descriptive "subtitle" in the store with the actual name of the mod (instead of "Mod").
- Custom "query language" to make it (fairly) simple to add or modify categories if desired.
- Compatible with the CategoryAdder mod, the "AddStoreCategory" script and the "StoreManager" feature in GlobalCompany

## How it works:
This script generally does two things. Firstly it adds a bunch of new/modified categories and then it moves items (vehicles, implements etc) between these different categories. 

Categories that are too specific/narrow will be merged, categories that are too general/broad will be split up and some items will be moved from Vehicles to Implements (and vice versa). Highly specialized categories such as Animal Transport or Slurry Tanks is left untouched while more generic items such as "autoloading flatbed semitrailers" is moved from Baling Technology to a more generic Semitrailers category.

## Final notes:
For a complete list of all new categories, especially if you want to include any of them in your own mod, check out my project page at https://go.xilent.se/fs19_tidyshop. Also, the list of vehicles and implements that this mod covers is by no means complete so I encourage you to post suggetions at the aforementioned project page.

A special thanks goes to ViperGTS96 for creating the great mod 'Category Adder' which pointed me in the right direction to realize this idea!
